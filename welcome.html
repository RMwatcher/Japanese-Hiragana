    <h1>Greetings</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my short tutorial for learning Hiragana. I began learning Japanese since my time at Clark
        College during the Fall term of the year 2020. The only previous I've had with Japanese was watching Japanese
        animation or Anime, since I've been a fan for over 15 years.</p>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to learn Japanese just so I can follow along with my favorite
        shows without needing captions. At the moment, I've only have learn the basic of Japanese which involves learning the characters of Hiragana, verbs, some adjectives, as well as many phrases that people would use daily. I also learned about the three writing systems that make up the Japanese language: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Some of you may already know about these so this would serve as a refresher for you.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you some Hiragana which involves the basics of Hiragana as well as the characters that makes up Hiragana. This will also involve some basics about Katakana as well. Let's get started!</p>

    <h2>Hiragana basics</h2>
    <p>Hiragana is used for native Japanese in their writing. Hiragana consists of: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>46 Basic Hiragana Syllables</li>
        <li>23 Additional Sounds (voiced Consonants)</li>
        <li>33 Additional Sounds (contracted sounds)</li>
        <li>Double Consonants</li>
        <li>Long Vowels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For Hiragana and Katakana: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Two syllabaries, or a single syllable sounds, that represent a same sets of phonetic sounds.</li>
        <li>Learning both Hiragana and Katakana will teach you all the distinct sounds of Japanese.</li>
        <li>They're both fairly quick and easy to learn.</li>
        <li>Each character can only have one pronunciation. No two characters can sound alike.</li>
        <li>Each Hiragana characters don't have meaning attached to them.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>We would learn more about Katakana at a later time, but just remember that they share some characteristics with Hiragana but serve a different purpose to the Japanese writing system. As a general note, Japanese does not use spaces to separate the words.</p>

    <h2>Hiragana chart</h2>
    <p>The following chart displays all 46 basic Hiragana Syllables that are used in the Japanese writing system. Some of these characters have additional contracted and voiced sounds that share the same syllables but have a different sound to them. These additional sounds will each be displayed on their chart.</p>

    <h2>Voiced Sounds</h2>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, some of these characters can go into additional sounds simply by adding a symbol at the end of each syllable, like a quotation mark or a small circle.</p>

    <p>As you can see, the characters of: </p>

        <li>t becomes d</li>
        <li>h becomes b</li>
        <li>h also becomes p</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The syllables look the same except it has a additional symbol at the top right of each character to tell them apart. They also produce a different sound compare to the basic syllables.</p>
